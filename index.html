        <p>
           This fun game is a version of the widely know version of rock paper scissors.<br>
           To make it a little more challenging two extra options were introduced; lizard and Spock.<br> 
           Check out the rules in the picture below!<br> 
           P.S.; While many may know this game from tv series Big Bang Theory,<br>
           It was actually invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla in the 1990's
