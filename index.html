                    This fun game is a version of the widely known version of rock, paper or scissors.<br>
                    To make it a little more challenging two extra options were introduced; lizard and Spock.<br>

                    P.S; While many may know this game from tv series Big Bang Theory,<br>
                    It was actually invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla in the 1990's<br>
